== Zimbra Talk V2
Zimbra Talk V2 is the newest addition to the Zimbra product line-up. Zimbra Talk V2 will be available in version 8.8.8 onwards.
This is enterprise-level messaging and videoconferencing built inside the Zimbra web client. It includes one-on-one and group messaging and videoconferencing, along with full screen and file sharing capabilities.

Zimbra Talk V2 inherits some of the features from the previous Zimbra Chat, but the vast majority of the features are new. Some of the inherited features from Chat are:

* 1-to-1 text messaging
* Buddy List Management 
* Chat history, which is now saved in the chat panel and not a Chat folder in email
* Emojis 
* Status or presence management
* User preferences 
* And it works out of the box with no server configuration
